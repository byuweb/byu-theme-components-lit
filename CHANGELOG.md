# byu-theme-components CHANGELOG

## Breaking changes between 1.x.x and 2.x.x

### `byu-header`

- The `subtitle` class is no longer supported. To create a subtitle, place an element in the `subtitle` slot.

### `byu-search`

- The `search-input-selector` attribute is now camelCase as opposed to ke-bab case. To define a custom search input selector, use the `searchInputSelector` attribute.
